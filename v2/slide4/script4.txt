Hello and welcome back to our series on Poisson Regression and Poisson resgression with robust standard errors

We've finished our sections on regular poisson regression, so you should now have a good idea on how to apply the regression models to real data on R


===============
slide 2
===============
Now we will begin to introduce the modified Poisson Regression method with what we call Robust Standard Errors

For this video, we will discuss the motivation for even considering this modified model, understand the differences between this and the "regular" model, and then of course, understanding how to interpret the parameters and outputs that this modified model gives


===============
slide 3
===============
So, the question is, what is Poisson Regression with Robust Standard Errors?

In short, it is a slight modification to the regular Poisson regression model that allows us to apply it to data with binary outcomes

Binary in the sense that the output variable should only take on two possible values- for example whether or not you have a certain illness.

In general, we want to be able to model data that will give us a better idea of whether or not an outcome will occur given a certain scenario


===============
slide 4
===============
The reason we care about this type of binary data regression is because many real world situations can be modeled with such a framework

Health-related problems such as trying to quantify the levels of association between certain factors and the onset of a disease is one scenario that sees heavy use of binary data regression

Fields such as epidemiology and public health frequently use binary data regression methods such as logistic regression or our topic of choice, poisson regression with robust standard errors, to build models and estimate these types of associations

A specific example is the ability for Poisson Regression with Robust Standard Errors to estimate something called the relative risk, which is one of the methods epidemiologists use quantify the strength of association between a disease and certain factors that should contribute to that disease.


===============
slide 5
===============
Let's start with the framework of the Poisson Regression model with Robust Standard Errors

In general, most things are the same- especially with the equation of the model itself

We are using the log link function for the GLM with our predictor variables being represented by the betas

Our output variable, Y, is still of a Poisson distribution, so the expected output is Lambda- the expected value of Y

What changes is the interpretation of the output of the model, but more on that later


===============
slide 6
===============
So we've said that much of the model is the same as the regular Poisson Regression model, while the type of data they are supposed to analyze are different

The question is, what adjustments we will need to make

The main concern that requires attention is the Poisson distribution's assumption of the expected value being equal to its variance

In practice, that is not always the case, and especially because now that we want to work with binary data, this assumption will usually overestimate the variance of the data itself


===============
slide 7
===============
We illustrate here why the Poisson Regression model theoretically overestimates the true variane

Recall for binomial variables, the expected value is np while the variance is np(1-p)

Since (1-p) is a value between 0 and 1, np(1-p) has to be smaller than np- hence the expected value being greater than the variance of binomial variables

Under our Poisson Regression model, however, we are assuming the variance and expected value are the same

This causes our model to have an estimated variance that is theoretically greater than the variance shown in the binary data


===============
slide 8
===============
Given this, the only adjustment we really need to make is with the variance of the predictor variables that we are working with

For the maximum likelihood estimates of the predictor variables, we want to replace them with "robust" standard errors- also known as Huber-White Standard Errors

Written in matrix notation, the equation on the screen gives us the robust standard errors that we want to use


===============
slide 9
===============
A name you will frequently hear in regards to this robust standard error is the sandwich estimate of the variance

This is due to the appearance of the equation as a covariance matrix being "sandwiched" inbetween products of matrices

The sandwich estimate of variance is simple to compute with software such as R as it has an aptly named sandwich library that has built-in functions to calculate the sandwich estimate


===============
slide 10
===============
Now, outside of the necessary adjustments to make to the model that we've just previously discussed, the two regression models are generally the same

Since we use the same likelihood functions, the maximum likelihood estimates for the beta's will be exactly the same

As discussed in the previous slides, the difference lies in the use of the sandwich estimate of the variance for this model

Lastly, because we are applying this model to analyze a different type of data, the interpretations of our model's parameters will differ


===============
slide 11
===============
We can, however, use the same process of working with the difference of expected values given only a one unit difference in the input variable in order to drive the meaning of the parameters

Note that because the model's equation is the same as the regular Poisson Regression model's, all of the steps end up being exactly the same 


===============
slide 12
===============
What changes in this derivation process is how we interpret the final result

Because the expected value of binary variables is a probability, we want to interpret the final line as a ratio of probabilities and not as a ratio of counts


===============
slide 13
===============
Let's take a look at an example

We will use the same example as in video #2 to illustrate the difference in interpretations

Assume we have the ratio of the expected value of outcome given an input of x+1 versus an input of just x, is equal to 1.15

What this means is that if we increase the input variable, x, by one unit while holding every other predictor constant, the expected value of the PROBABILITY OF THE OUTCOME increases by 15 percent

Compare this to the interpretation of the regular Poisson Regression model where a value of 1.15 means that the expected value of the COUNT increases by 15 percent


===============
slide 14
===============
With that, we now have the theoretical background necessary to proceed with an example of how to apply the Poisson Regression model with Robust Standard Errors to some real binary data

In the next video, we will work through an example of how to run this regression model on R

We will see you there
